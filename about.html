                Forth was born out of a desire to create a fashion brand that stood the test of time, combining classic elegance with modern innovation. Founded by designer Emma Larkson in New York, Forth quickly established itself as a brand dedicated to quality, sustainability, and thoughtful design. Sourcing premium, sustainable materials and partnering with skilled artisans, Forth crafted garments known for their timeless appeal and exceptional craftsmanship.

                As the brand grew, it embraced innovative technologies, such as eco-friendly dyes and smart fabrics, while staying true to traditional tailoring. Sustainability became a cornerstone of Forth’s mission, with initiatives like garment recycling and biodegradable packaging setting new standards in ethical fashion.

Today, Forth continues to push the boundaries of fashion, driven by a commitment to quality, innovation, and a better future for the planet.
