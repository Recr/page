# Clothes Brand Page

This is a page created to simulate a clothes shop.
[Click Here to Acess](https://recr.github.io/page/)

I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The products page uses AJAX to simulate requests.
Also the products page uses localStorage to simulate the cart with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
